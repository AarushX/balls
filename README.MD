# Gravity Balls Simulator

A Python-based gravity simulator powered by Pygame. This interactive simulation helps you visualize and understand how gravitational forces between objects interact in a two-dimensional environment.

## Features

- Add and interact with multiple balls representing celestial objects.
- Real-time physics simulation including gravity and collision effects.
- Adjustable simulation speed.
- Resizable window with dynamic boundary updates.
- User-friendly control panel to manage simulation features.
- Pastel-colored balls for a visually pleasing experience.
- Excellent performance with smooth animations and updates.

## Installation and Usage

To install the necessary dependencies for this project, simply run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed the required package and have a release of python that supports pygame (3.10 works), run the `main.py` script to execute the Gravity Simulator.

```bash
python3 main.py
```

When the simulation window opens, you can interact with the balls using your mouse. You can also use the top menu bar to perform various actions:

- **Add Ball:** Click this button to add a new ball to the simulation. The new ball will be placed at an available location.
- **Change Bound:** Toggles boundary visibility and updates boundary constraints when the window is resized.
- **Pause:** Use this button to pause or resume the simulation.
